# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Personal projects help students develop and demonstrate skills, and we're all about cultivating a wide list of ideas for folks entering the infosec field. We're very open to project ideas and list contributions from RITSEC and the public.

## Considerations

Any project that is directly security related, or would help develop security-relevant skills, or just be found interesting by computing security students and practitioners is fair game. When in doubt, we'll accept it.

## Adding Project Ideas

To add your contribution, first fork this repository. Be sure to fetch the latest changes before you open your pull request.

Copy templates/idea.md to ideas/\<your-idea\>.md, and add your name, current date, and time estimate. Don't worry too much about these.
  
Your name helps students ask questions, the date helps with archiving, and the time estimate is relative to other projects - just give a best guess. If you want a frame of reference for it, assume the reader is a first or second year computing student.

Add a description of what this project does, and ideally some of the goals - what should the [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) be capable of?

A going further/extensions section is also **highly** encouraged. You can include some ways to extend this project, and different directions it could be taken in.

Once your idea is added, you can add it to a list. **Please add yours to lists/all.md**, and any others that would fit.

## Adding a List
  
We'll also accept new lists - to get started, try to include 3-5 projects that fit under your list. Just like with ideas, you can use the list template.
